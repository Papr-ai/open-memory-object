# Open Memory Object Consortium Charter

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)  
**Status:** In Formation  
**Effective Date:** July 2025 (Target)  
**Last Updated:** June 26, 2025

---

## 1. Mission Statement

The **Open Memory Object (OMO) Consortium** exists to establish universal standards for AI memory interoperability with built-in safety, privacy, and consent management. We enable seamless memory portability across platforms, databases, and AI systems while prioritizing user sovereignty and preparing the foundation for safe AGI development.

### Vision
A world where AI memory is portable, secure, and user-controlled‚Äîwhere switching AI providers doesn't mean losing years of personalized context, and where safety is built into the memory layer from day one.

## 2. Problem Statement

The AI memory ecosystem is fragmented across proprietary formats, creating:

- **Platform Lock-in:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Google store memory in closed schemas
- **Integration Tax:** Developers build bespoke adapters for each memory platform
- **Data Sovereignty Loss:** Users cannot export, audit, or delete their memories
- **Safety Gaps:** Inconsistent consent, risk assessment, and content filtering
- **Innovation Drag:** Startups duplicate infrastructure instead of building features
- **AGI Risk:** No standardized safety protocols as AI systems become more capable

## 3. Core Principles

### üõ°Ô∏è **Safety First**
Every memory object carries built-in safety metadata, enabling automatic risk assessment and content filtering before reaching AI models.

### üë§ **User Sovereignty** 
Memory belongs to users, not platforms. All operations must respect explicit consent and provide "forget-me" controls.

### üîí **Privacy by Design**
Consent tracking is mandatory. Every memory object explicitly records how consent was obtained and permissions granted.

### üîó **Universal Interoperability**
One standard across memory platforms, databases, cloud providers, and AI systems. All specifications, reference implementations, and governance processes are publicly available under permissive licenses.

### ‚ö° **Developer Simplicity**
Single integration point reduces complexity and accelerates innovation.

## 4. Scope & Objectives

### 4.1 Technical Scope

**Primary Deliverables:**
