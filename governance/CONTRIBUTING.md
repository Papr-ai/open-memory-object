## üéØ Implementation Guidelines

### Platform Integration
If you're implementing OMO in your platform:
- **Start with Core Schema:** Implement required fields first
- **Use Extensions Wisely:** Namespace platform-specific features (e.g., `papr:relationships`)
- **Validate Rigorously:** Use our JSON schema for validation
- **Test Interoperability:** Use our certification test suite
- **Document Extensions:** Submit documentation for your extensions

### Database Integration
For database providers implementing OMO:
- **Storage Mapping:** Document how OMO fields map to your storage model
- **Query Translation:** Provide query translation for OMO operations
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Share performance characteristics
- **Migration Tools:** Provide tools for existing data migration

### Application Integration
For applications consuming OMO:
- **SDK Usage:** Use reference SDKs when available
- **Consent Handling:** Respect consent and ACL fields
- **Risk Assessment:** Implement appropriate filtering based on risk levels
- **Privacy Compliance:** Follow our privacy guidelines
