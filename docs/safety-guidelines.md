# Open Memory Object (OMO) Safety Guidelines

![OMO Safety Badge](./assets/omo-safe-badge.png)

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)  
**Status:** Working Group 3 Development  
**Last Updated:** June 26, 2025

---

## 🛡️ Overview

The Open Memory Object standard prioritizes **safety first** in AI memory systems. These guidelines ensure that memory objects carry built-in safety metadata, enabling automatic risk assessment and content filtering before reaching AI models.

As AI systems become more capable and approach AGI, the memory layer becomes a critical safety boundary. OMO provides the foundation for safe, auditable, and controllable AI memory systems.

## 🎯 Core Safety Principles

### 1. Safety by Default
- All memory objects must include safety metadata
- Unknown or unassessed content defaults to restricted access
- Fail-safe mechanisms prevent unsafe content from reaching AI models

### 2. Explicit Consent
- Every memory object requires explicit consent tracking
- Users maintain sovereignty over their memory data
- Consent can be revoked at any time ("right to be forgotten")

### 3. Risk Assessment
- Automated content analysis for safety risks
- Human-in-the-loop for sensitive content decisions
- Continuous monitoring and re-assessment capabilities

### 4. Transparency & Auditability
- All safety decisions must be logged and auditable
- Users can inspect why content was flagged or restricted
- Clear escalation paths for safety disputes

### 5. Privacy by Design
- Minimal data collection and processing
- Strong access controls and encryption
- Regular privacy impact assessments

## 📋 Safety Schema Requirements

### Required Safety Fields

Every OMO object MUST include these safety-related fields:

```json
{
  "consent": {
    "type": "string",
    "enum": ["explicit", "implicit", "terms", "none"],
    "description": "How consent was obtained for this memory"
  },
  "risk": {
    "type": "string", 
    "enum": ["none", "sensitive", "flagged"],
    "default": "none",
    "description": "Safety risk assessment level"
  },
  "acl": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "read": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
      "write": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }
    },
    "description": "Access control list for read/write permissions"
  }
}

```

## 🔍 Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Levels
- **none** – No Identified Risks
  - *Criteria:* General, non-sensitive information
  - *Examples:* Public facts, general preferences, non-personal data
  - *Access:* Unrestricted (subject to ACL)
  - *Processing:* Standard AI model access allowed
- **sensitive** – Sensitive Information
  - *Criteria:* Personal, private, or potentially harmful information
  - *Examples:* Personal details, private conversations, health information
  - *Access:* Restricted to authorized applications/users
  - *Processing:* Requires explicit user consent for AI model access
- **flagged** – High-Risk Content
  - *Criteria:* Content that violates policies or poses safety risks
  - *Examples:* Harmful instructions, private credentials, illegal content
  - *Access:* Blocked from AI model access
  - *Processing:* Human review required before any processing

### Content Categories
- **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
  - *Detection:* Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, SSNs
  - *Risk Level:* sensitive or flagged depending on context
  - *Handling:* Requires explicit consent, strong access controls
- **Financial Information**
  - *Detection:* Credit card numbers, bank accounts, financial records
  - *Risk Level:* flagged by default
  - *Handling:* Requires explicit consent, encryption at rest
- **Health Information**
  - *Detection:* Medical records, health conditions, medications
  - *Risk Level:* sensitive or flagged depending on jurisdiction
  - *Handling:* HIPAA/GDPR compliance required
- **Harmful Content**
  - *Detection:* Violence, self-harm, illegal activities, hate speech
  - *Risk Level:* flagged
  - *Handling:* Blocked from AI access, human review required
- **Credentials & Secrets**
  - *Detection:* Passwords, API keys, tokens, certificates
  - *Risk Level:* flagged
  - *Handling:* Immediate blocking, security team notification

## 🤖 Automated Safety Assessment

### Implementation Requirements
All OMO implementations MUST provide automated safety assessment:

```python
class SafetyAssessor:
    def assess_memory(self, content: str, metadata: dict) -> SafetyResult:
        """
        Assess memory content for safety risks
        
        Returns:
            SafetyResult with risk level, confidence, and flags
        """
        pass
    
    def should_block_ai_access(self, memory: OMOObject) -> bool:
        """
        Determine if memory should be blocked from AI model access
        """
        return memory.risk == "flagged"
```

#### Assessment Pipeline
- **Content Analysis**
  - Text classification for sensitive content
  - Pattern matching for PII, credentials, etc.
  - Contextual analysis for risk assessment
- **Metadata Validation**
  - Verify consent is properly recorded
  - Check access control permissions
  - Validate retention policies
- **Risk Scoring**
  - Combine content and context analysis
  - Apply organization-specific risk policies
  - Generate confidence scores
- **Decision Making**
  - Assign risk level based on assessment
  - Flag for human review if needed
  - Log all decisions for audit trail

#### Reference Implementation
```typescript
interface SafetyAssessment {
  riskLevel: 'none' | 'sensitive' | 'flagged';
  confidence: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  flags: string[];
  categories: string[];
  assessedAt: string; // ISO 8601 timestamp
  assessedBy: string; // system identifier
  reviewRequired: boolean;
}

class OMOSafetyAssessor {
  async assessContent(content: string): Promise<SafetyAssessment> {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  shouldAllowAIAccess(memory: OMOObject): boolean {
    return memory.risk !== 'flagged' && 
           this.hasValidConsent(memory) &&
           this.checkAccessPermissions(memory);
  }
}
```

## 👤 Consent Management

### Consent Types
- **explicit** – Direct User Consent
  - *Requirement:* User explicitly agreed to memory storage
  - *Evidence:* Timestamp, consent text, user action
  - *Revocation:* User can revoke at any time
  - *Example:* User clicks "Save this conversation to memory"
- **implicit** – Contextual Consent
  - *Requirement:* Consent implied by user action
  - *Evidence:* User behavior indicating consent
  - *Revocation:* User can opt-out retroactively
  - *Example:* User continues using service after privacy notice
- **terms** – Terms of Service Consent
  - *Requirement:* Covered under platform terms of service
  - *Evidence:* User acceptance of terms
  - *Revocation:* Subject to terms modification process
  - *Example:* General platform usage consent
- **none** – No Consent
  - *Requirement:* No consent obtained
  - *Handling:* Restricted processing, deletion required
  - *Use Case:* Legacy data, error conditions
  - *Action:* Obtain consent or delete data

#### Consent Validation
```json
{
  "consent": "explicit",
  "ext": {
    "consent:obtainedAt": "2025-06-26T10:30:00Z",
    "consent:method": "ui-dialog",
    "consent:evidence": "user-clicked-save",
    "consent:version": "privacy-policy-v2.1",
    "consent:canRevoke": true,
    "consent:revokedAt": null
  }
}
```

## 🔐 Access Control Implementation

### ACL Structure
```json
{
  "acl": {
    "read": [
      "user:alice",           // Specific user
      "app:calendar-agent",   // Specific application
      "role:admin",          // Role-based access
      "org:acme-corp"        // Organization access
    ],
    "write": [
      "user:alice",          // Only user can modify
      "app:memory-manager"   // Trusted memory management app
    ]
  }
}
```

### Permission Validation
```python
def check_access(memory: OMOObject, principal: str, operation: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if principal has permission for operation on memory object
    
    Args:
        memory: OMO object to check
        principal: User/app/role requesting access (e.g., "user:alice")
        operation: "read" or "write"
    
    Returns:
        True if access allowed, False otherwise
    """
    if operation not in memory.acl:
        return False
    
    allowed_principals = memory.acl[operation]
    
    # Direct match
    if principal in allowed_principals:
        return True
    
    # Role-based access (implementation specific)
    if any(p.startswith("role:") for p in allowed_principals):
        return check_role_membership(principal, allowed_principals)
    
    return False
```
