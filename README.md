## Why OMO?

LLM-powered agents and AI applications depend on **long-term memory** for personalized experiences. Today, that memory is **fragmented** across proprietary formats, creating:

- **Platform Lock-in** - OpenAI, Anthropic, Google store memory in closed schemas
- **Integration Tax** - Developers build bespoke adapters for each memory platform  
- **Data Sovereignty Loss** - Users can't export, audit, or delete their memories
- **Safety Gaps** - Inconsistent consent, risk assessment, and content filtering
- **Innovation Drag** - Startups duplicate infrastructure instead of building features

**OMO solves this** with a universal, safety-first standard for AI memory objects.

## Core Principles

### 🛡️ **Safety First**
Built-in risk assessment and content filtering metadata in every memory object.

### 👤 **User Sovereignty** 
Memory belongs to users, not platforms. Explicit consent and "forget-me" controls.

### 🔒 **Privacy by Design**
Mandatory consent tracking and granular access controls.

### 🔗 **Universal Interoperability**
One standard across memory platforms, databases, cloud providers, and AI systems.

### ⚡ **Developer Simplicity**
Single integration point reduces complexity and accelerates innovation.
